# Mental-Health-Prediction
Built an end-to-end ML pipeline to predict mental health outcomes from survey data. Preprocessed data (missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling), identified key predictors with ExtraTreesClassifier, and optimized a Random Forest model using RandomizedSearchCV, achieving robust results across accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
