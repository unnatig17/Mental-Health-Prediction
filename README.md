# Mental Health Prediction Project

A machine learning project that predicts mental health conditions based on survey data. The model was trained using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and AUC were used to measure performance.

## Features
- Preprocessed survey data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Applied feature engineering and data scaling for model readiness.
- Identified key predictors using ExtraTreesClassifier.
- Trained and optimized a Random Forest model with RandomizedSearchCV.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
